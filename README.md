The male preponderance n neonatal septicemia could be linked to the X- chromosome

ed immune regulatory gene factor resulting in the host's susceptibility to infections in

males (Khatua et al.,).

O Maximum culture positive cases were seen in neonates less than one week of age (early

onset septicemia) as compared to neonates aged more than one week (late onset septicemia)

in the present study.

UThe mean age of onset of septicemia in the present study was 4.81 years.

Tallur et al., Roy et al.," and Varsha et al., reported similar findings in their studies. The

cause of ascending infection could be due to the rupture of membranes or during the passage

of the baby through the infected birth canal or at the time of resuscitation in the labor room.

uG. Karthikeyan et al, reported an equal proportion of EOS and LOS cases in their study,

Wnlle the study by R.S. Jaswal et al.," shows a higher proportion of LOS cases than EOS

dSes. These findings could suggest a nosocomial source of infection and the geographical
variation in the infecting organism.

ne reason for the higher proportion of EOS could be the immature immunological

respo in the newborns during the first week of life, making them more susceptible to

nfections in this period.
