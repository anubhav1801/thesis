Present study

O In this study the proportion of culture positive septicemic cases were higher among the

very low birth weight neonates when compared with the Low and Normal birth weight

neonatesS.

The mean birth weight of the neonates in this study was 2.24 +0.5 kgs.

D The results of the present study are comparable with the studies conducted by Khatua et

al.17 Tallur et al." and Zawar et al.

According to Barbara J. Stoll et al., 1991, the rate of infection is inversely proportional to

the weight at birth, and low IgG levels in the very low birth weight neonates contributes to

the higher susceptibility to infections in these neonates.
